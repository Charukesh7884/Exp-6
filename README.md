## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION (SRS)

### 1. Introduction  
The **Online Examination System (OES)** is designed to automate the process of conducting exams, registering students, evaluating results, and generating reports. It streamlines the examination workflow for educational institutions and ensures efficiency, security, and accessibility.

### 2. Purpose  
The main purpose of this project is to simplify the process of conducting online exams, registering students, evaluating their performance, and managing question papers digitally, ensuring smooth operation and data consistency.

### 3. Scope  
This system includes:
- Online student registration and login  
- Exam scheduling and management  
- Question paper generation  
- Online examination interface for students  
- Real-time evaluation and result generation  
- Reporting of exam performance  
- Admin management of users, exams, and settings  

---

### 4. Functional Requirements  
- **Student Registration:** Allow students to register for online exams by entering their personal details.  
- **Exam Registration:** Enable students to register for available exams and receive schedules.  
- **Exam Taking:** Students can take an online exam at the scheduled time, including answering multiple-choice, short-answer, and essay-type questions.  
- **Result Evaluation:** The system evaluates student answers in real-time or after the exam, depending on the exam type.  
- **Exam Scheduling:** Admins can set up, schedule, and manage exams.  
- **Exam Reporting:** Generate detailed reports of student performance for each exam.  
- **User Management:** Admin can manage student registrations, exam schedules, and settings.  

---

### 5. Non-Functional Requirements  
- **Security:** The system must ensure secure login, data protection, and exam integrity.  
- **Performance:** The system should handle a high number of simultaneous users without performance degradation.  
- **Reliability:** The system must be reliable in terms of availability and data integrity during exam sessions.  
- **Usability:** The interface should be simple and intuitive for students and administrators.  
- **Scalability:** The system must be able to scale to accommodate increasing numbers of users and exams.  

---

### 6. System Actors  
- **Student:** Registers for exams, takes exams, and views exam results.  
- **Administrator:** Manages exam schedules, student registrations, and system settings.  
- **System:** Evaluates student responses, generates results, and maintains data integrity.  

---

### 7. Use Cases  
The primary use cases of the system include:
1. **Student Registration**: A student registers for the system by entering their personal and academic details.  
2. **Exam Registration**: A student registers for an available exam by selecting the desired exam from the list of available exams.  
3. **Login**: A registered user logs in using their credentials to access the system.  
4. **Take Exam**: A student starts and completes an online exam during the scheduled time.  
5. **Evaluate Results**: The system automatically evaluates the exam responses and generates the results (real-time or post-exam).  
6. **Generate Reports**: The administrator can generate reports of student performance, including pass/fail rates, scores, and other metrics.  
7. **Manage Users and Exams (Admin)**: The admin manages student accounts, exam schedules, and system configurations.  
8. **Logout**: A user can log out from the system after completing their session.

Each use case defines how actors interact with the system to perform a specific function within the online examination process.
